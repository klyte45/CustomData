<color=yellow>Welcome to the Custom Data Mod</color>

This mod is being designed to replace some other mods that I (Klyte45) did earlier with the goal of extend the data stored for instances in game.
For now, it replace around 70% of the old Addresses Mod and also have features that appeared in very old Service Vehicle Manager.

<color=green>Update r6 (18/NOV/22)</color>
- Fixed UI scale in non-1080p based resolutions

<color=yellow>Features available in this first version</color>
[WE] = Write Everywhere mod
[VS] = Vehicle Skins mod

- All basic addressing features from Addresses mod, like:
	> Postal code & Address lines
	> Auto naming roads from prebuilt bank of names
	> Change Cims names generation method
	> Set up a district/city color
	> Change neighbors names
	> Auto generate names for buildings based on streets or districts names

- <color=yellow>NEW!</color> Add building extra data:
	> Color for their generated vehicles (if applicable - like old SVM)
	> [WE] Logo (use an image with size 256x256 - it will be saved within the savegame)
	> [WE] Enables to use the Logo in the Write Everywhere mod's layouts
	> [WE] Serial number format for the vehicles spawned from the building (if applicable)
	> [VS] Default vehicle skin to be used by all vehicles from this - will ignore if the skin name is not available
	> Also access Outside Connections buildings, so you can change their custom data too!

It's planned to re-add the stadiums teams options too in a future release.
